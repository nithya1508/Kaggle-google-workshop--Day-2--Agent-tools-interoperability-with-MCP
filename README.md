Vertex AI Agents – Hands-On Labs (Day 1 & Day 2)

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Google Cloud Vertex AI Agents, covering foundational concepts, agent architectures, tools, best practices, and real-world workflows for building intelligent agentic systems.

The notebooks included here represent structured lab exercises across two days of exploration. They demonstrate how modern agent frameworks operate in production environments and how agent tools enable complex, multi-step reasoning and action pipelines.

📁 Repository Overview
Day 1 – Agent Fundamentals

day-1a-from-prompt-to-action.ipynb
Introduces the basics of Vertex AI Agents. Covers project setup, environment initialization, prompt execution, and how agents convert natural-language instructions into actions.

day-1b-agent-architectures.ipynb
Provides a deeper look into agent architectures. Explores local vs. remote agents, deployment considerations, streaming responses, asynchronous interactions, and design principles for scalable agent systems.

Day 2 – Agent Tools & Best Practices

day-2a-agent-tools.ipynb
Focuses on how agents use tools—such as web search, retrieval functions, calculators, and custom functions—to extend their capabilities beyond language generation. Demonstrates multi-tool orchestration, validation flows, and tool policies.

day-2b-agent-tools-best-practices.ipynb
Covers best practices for building production-grade agent tools, including error handling, guardrails, tool design patterns, safety considerations, output validation, and maintaining reliable agent workflows.
